--------------------Editing .bash_profile --------------------- 
#Access and edit it from terminal: 
Innas-MacBook-Pro:~ innakorzhouska$ vim .bash_profile
.........

VIM editor is used to edit inside (see commands related to VIM)
inside the file should have only needed environments:
":" is used to add another environment 
":$PATH" - in case of new line the new path will consist of the newly added line and includes the old line of pathes as well
Sometimes "export PYTHONPATH=" is used as alternative ???
"" is optinal




-------Example from Cynthia's bash_profile

export PYTHONPATH=“${PYTHONPATH}:/Users/cynthiacorrea/python_packages:/Users/cynthiacorrea/python_packages/my_application/config:/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages”

export PYTHONPATH

export PS1=“$ ”

# added by Anaconda3 5.2.0 installer
export PATH=“/anaconda3/bin:$PATH”
# export snowsql=“/Applications/SnowSQL.app/Contents/MacOS/snowsql”
alias snowsql=/Applications/SnowSQL.app/Contents/MacOS/snowsql



--------Simple version
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/bin/python
  
# added by Snowflake SnowSQL installer v1.0
export PATH=/Applications/SnowSQL.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH



--------My working profile
export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:$PATH
  
# added by Miniconda3 installer
export PATH="/Users/innakorzhouska/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"

# added by Snowflake SnowSQL installer v1.0
export PATH=/Applications/SnowSQL.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH


after changing of  bash_profile its important to source it(runs the command so it will be registered in the system//instead of restarting the cpoumputer):
Innas-MacBook-Pro:~ innakorzhouska$ source .bash_profile
