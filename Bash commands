Bash commands cheat-sheet:

Running .sh files:
https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php

simple example of bash file:
#------------myscript.sh----------
#!/bin/bash
# A sample Bash script, by Ryan
echo Hello World!

#-------running the script:
user@bash: /home/ryan/myscript.sh
Hello World!
user@bash: 

#another way without writing entire path:
user@bash: ./myscript.sh


#-----in Windows:
sh name.sh


#When you just type a name on the command line Bash tries to find it in a series of directories stored in a variable called $PATH. 
We can see the current value of this variable using the command echo



#----------to see path variable:
user@bash: echo $PATH
/home/ryan/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
user@bash: 


#!/bin/bash
This is the first line of the script above. The hash exclamation mark ( #! ) character sequence is referred to as the Shebang.
Following it is the path to the interpreter (or program) that should be used to run (or interpret) the rest of the lines in the text file. 
(For Bash scripts it will be the path to Bash, but there are many other types of scripts and they each have their own interpreter.)
It is possible to leave out the line with the shebang and still run the script but it is unwise. 
If you are at a terminal and running the Bash shell and you execute a script without a shebang then Bash will assume it is a Bash script. 
So this will only work assuming the user running the script is running it in a Bash shell and there are a variety of reasons why this may not be the case, which is dangerous.

You can also run Bash, passing the script as an argument:
user@bash: bash myscript.sh
Hello World!
user@bash:

#------------Variables:
https://www.shellscript.sh/variables1.html
Note that there must be no spaces around the "=" sign: VAR=value works; VAR = value doesn't work.

#!/bin/sh
MY_MESSAGE="Hello World"
echo $MY_MESSAGE

#!/bin/sh
echo What is your name?
read MY_NAME
echo "Hello $MY_NAME - hope you're well."

#------Example of a python script with 3 parameters, which are path to files in following folders:
#!/bin/bash
#
python ./src/find_political_donors.py ./input/itcont.txt ./output/medianvals_by_zip.txt ./output/medianvals_by_date.txt
